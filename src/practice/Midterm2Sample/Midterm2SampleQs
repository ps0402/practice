1. when implementing a stack using a linked list vs array, which statement is WRONG
    () an array, insertion and deletion operations take more time
    as the memory locations are consecutive and fixed. in a linked list case,
    a new element is stored at the first free and available memory location
    with only a single overhead step of storing the address of the
    previous node.
    () linked list implementation gives you more flexibility over the containers capacity since you can
    basically always add more items. in an array, you are limited in terms of capacity.
    () CORRECT options: linked list is a better option in terms of flexible stack capacity w/o requiring
    memory copy. it is possible to use the front of an array as the "top" of a stack. stack implemented using
    a linked list has a slightly higher storage overhead comparing to array due to the additional "next  variable
    in each node.
    (D) WRONG option: for the push and pop methods, using array is much faster because otherwise a linked list
    ALWAYS requires traversing to the node at the end.
2. without an exit condition, a recursive function call will
    (B) continue executing until the code crashes with StackOverflowException
3. write pseudocode to implement the fibonacci sequence with recursion. the math definition is:
    fib(x) = fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)

    Integer fib(Integer n)
    {
        if(n <= 1)
            return n;
        else
            return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))
    }
4. given the code :
        LinkedListCloset closet = new LinkedListCloset(15);

        closet.put(new Clothes("red hoodie"));
        closet.put(new Clothes("ice racing logo t-shirt"));
        closet.put(new Clothes("white jacket"));

        Clothes clothes = closet.retrieve("red hoodie");
        closet.put(clothes);
   How many clothes items can this closet object hold?
   () 15
   Which clothes are at the LEFT end (front of linked list) of the closet
   () white jacket
5. explain why Queue is used in the eCommerceSim. What is the benefit in using queue here?
   () queue is used to uncouple the payment, order, and shipping processes. This makes your code much more efficient
   in the sense that your program will be able to process many more orders. Orders are taken as fast as
   possible, then added to a queue. In that order, their payment is taken and the order is sent to a second
   queue. In the same first-in-first-out order, the orders are given to the shipping component. Now your three
   departments are able to coordinate using queues and execute at their own speeds.
6. given the following code :
       private static void verticalNumber(int num, List<Integer> result) {
           int lastDigit = num % 10;
           if (num / 10 != 0) {
               verticalNumber(num / 10, result);
           }
           result.add(lastDigit);
       }
   what is the content of the "result" list when num is 12345?
   ()
